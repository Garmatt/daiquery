This unfinished project, whose name is a bad pun on the words "query" and "daiquiri", is the evolution of something I wrote at work. Back then we were using a self-made ORM layer to access a MSSQL database, and we had classes that generated SQL statements. Soon we felt the need to decouple the SQL scripting logic from the rest of the layer, wrapping it up in a set of classes that were intended to represent the different parts of various SQL statements. We were in a hurry and, as a result, I wasn't too satisfied with the outcome. This project is my personal effort to write a better version of this library.
